Below are a few projects from my time with the [Ohio Public Library Information Network](https://oplin.ohio.gov). They are a vital institution for Ohio's Public Libraries, offering fast, reliable internet access, digital resources, web kits, tutorials, support, funding assistance, and more to libraries. This opportunity came about through the support of my library's director and a former library employee, now at OPLIN. It was a chance to improve my digital skills and broaden my  professional network, though I underestimated the depth of information, infrastructure, and meetings involved in maintaining the systems that I had used everyday. It has been an eye-opening experience. OPLIN's warm welcome provided invaluable opportunities to immerse myself in technology, allowing me to gain firsthand experience and a solid understanding of its complexities.

## OPLIN's Resources

Outside of data write-ups and visualizations I wanted to offer a better idea of OPLIN's services through a lay person's eyes. So, I created infographics from this perspective.

Here is an excerpt from my reflective essay:
"My final highlighted artifact is the social media announcement for Learning Outcome 1c. This simple social media announcement about my internship with the Ohio Public Library Information Network (OPLIN) holds significant weight in demonstrating my professional growth. It signifies the culmination of various experiences within the MLIS program, showcasing the practical application of my acquired knowledge.
   <br> The announcement not only expresses my initial interest in the library technical world but also highlights the crucial role OPLIN plays in supporting library functionality through vital behind-the-scenes work. Through this internship, I've gained valuable insights into library network infrastructure, digital resources, website management, funding landscapes, and grant processes. This comprehensive experience solidified my desire for a career focused on ensuring equitable access to information by strengthening library operations through these essential behind-the-scenes tasks. This internship truly exemplifies the application of everything I've learned in the MLIS program and serves as a marker of my professional development."
