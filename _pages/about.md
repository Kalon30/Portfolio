I'm excited to share my first website with you! This project has been a labor of love, allowing me to showcase the skills and abilities I've been learned over the last two years. I am very proud of the effort and time that went into this. I could not have done this without the help of [Derek](https://github.com/dzoladz) at [OPLIN](https://oplin.ohio.gov) who patiently helped me make the website look how I envisioned. Through this process I have gained a foundation in HTML and Markdown, and went through the tough process of breaking and fixing,and breaking code.
